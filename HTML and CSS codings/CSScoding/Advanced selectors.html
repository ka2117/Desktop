        <p id="Definition">  Every body continues to be in its state of rest or the state of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is acted upon by some external force.</p>

        <p1 id="Definition 1" class="second law"> The force acting on a body is directly proportional to the rate of change of linear momentum of the body and the change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force</p1>

        <p3 id="law 4" class="gravitational law.newtons theory on gravitaion">Every particle of matter in this universe attracts every other particle with a force. This force is directly proportional to the product of their masses
            and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of these masses. The direction of the force acts along the line joining the masses.</p3>
