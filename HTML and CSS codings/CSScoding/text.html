    <p1><b>Sea turtles live their life entirely in the oceans. But they still have a connection
        with land â€“ they must come ashore to lay eggs. Today, four of the sea turtle species
        mentioned above have become extremely rare in India. The Olive Ridleys, however, are
        still commonly seen nesting on sandy beaches all along our coasts.</b></p1>
